# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

I'm a Technical Writer and Front End Developer with over 8 years of professional experience in writing user guides and building websites with a design mindset.

Some examples of my past work include:

- Creating a high-quality suite of technical documentation (user guides, release notes, and internal guides) which I maintain each sprint. This has led to a reduction in support tickets and has increased the customers' understanding of how our applications work.
- Working on the front-end development of Angular applications to develop new features and improve the design and usability of existing features. This improved the overall quality of our applications and made them easier to use.
- Advocating for usability by establishing the usability design process by setting a minimum quota of UI/UX related tickets per sprint. This resulted in more thoughtful UI changes to our applications which has increased product usability.

I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to:

- Learn how a product works and test it out for myself to create easy-to-understand guides for others.
- Solve problems and help improve processes to make things more productive and efficient for everyone.
- Work with other people who are passionate about what they do.
- Work remotely while still being able to stay in contact with team members via chat, video calls, or asynchronously.
